# My GitHub Portfolio 🌍
Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio, where I document my learning journey in web development and backend programming. This is just the beginning—more projects to come as I improve! 🚀

📌 **Featured Projects**
- **Beginner Web Dev**  
A simple repo where I practice HTML & CSS. Nothing fancy—just experimenting and learning the basics. I'll keep adding more as I improve.

- **Recipe Book**  
A basic recipe website built with HTML, where I document my mom’s home-cooked recipes. Simple, clean, and straight to the point.

- **Expense Manager**  
A full-stack finance tracker built with **Spring Boot**, **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This application allows users to:
  - Add financial transactions
  - Fetch all transactions
  - Delete transactions
  The backend is powered by **Spring Boot** and **Java**, with a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage. The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide an intuitive user experience.

🔧 **Tech Stack**
- **HTML** & **CSS** for frontend basics
- **Java** & **Spring Boot** for backend development
- **SQL** for database management
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage
- More projects coming soon as I refine my skills. Stay tuned! 🚀
