# My GitHub Portfolio 🌍  

Welcome to my **GitHub Portfolio**, where I document my learning journey in **web development** and **backend programming**. This is just the beginning—more projects to come as I improve! 🚀  

## 📌 Featured Projects  

### [Beginner Web Dev](https://github.com/CodeNinjaSecrets/beginner-webdev)  
A simple repo where I practice **HTML & CSS**. Nothing fancy—just experimenting and learning the basics. I'll keep adding more as I improve.  

### [Recipe Book](https://github.com/CodeNinjaSecrets/recipe-book)  
A **basic recipe website** built with **HTML**, where I document my mom’s home-cooked recipes. Simple, clean, and straight to the point.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **HTML & CSS** for frontend basics  
- **Java & Spring Boot** (coming soon) for backend development  
- **SQL** for database management  

More projects coming soon as I refine my skills. Stay tuned! 🚀
